# 2D Java Game Framework

A collection of classes used for 2d game programming in Java. Much of the dirty work is taken care which makes this useful for beginner game programmers. 

## Usage

After building the .jar with the make.bat if you are on windows or make.sh if you are on linux, you just need to add the .jar file to your project. Once added you need to have your class extend game.framework.Game and implement all the methods from the abstract class. Once everything is set up correctly, we should just run the project and you should see a blank window with a blue background. (Better instructions to come later! :p)
